# CanvasHelper-1.2

This application allows for the import of groups and group assignments between courses in the Canvas LMS. Make sure to generate a user key in your Canvas user settings, and log into your institution's server (ex. "https://asu.instructure.com") in the Configure section of this application.

To run the application, either and navigate to the source file to run `python CanvasHelper1.2.py` or download the executable [here.](http://https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Skt_mYbetIqPWdkoQaIjlEKyK8MenBru/view?usp=sharing "here.")

Be CAREFUL when using this application or any other application that interacts with the Canvas API. Always double-check that your courses are correctly selected and that they are in the correct order.
